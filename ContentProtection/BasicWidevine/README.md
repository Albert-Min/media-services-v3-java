# Dynamically encrypt your content with Widevine

This sample demonstrates how to create a transform with built-in AdaptiveStreaming preset, submit a job, create a ContentKeyPolicy with Widevine configuration using a secret key, associate the ContentKeyPolicy with StreamingLocator, get a token and print a url for playback in a Azure Media Player. When a user requests Widevine-protected content, the player application requests a license from the Media Services license service. If the player application is authorized, the Media Services license service issues a license to the player. A Widevine license contains the decryption key that can be used by the client player to decrypt and stream the content.


> [!TIP]
> The `BasicWidevine.java` file (in the `BasicWidevine\src\main\java\sample` folder) has extensive comments.

## Prerequisites

* Java JDK 1.8 or newer installed
